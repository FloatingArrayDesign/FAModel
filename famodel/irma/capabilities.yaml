# capabilities.yaml
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines standardized capabilities for vessels and equipment.
# Each entry needs numeric values per specific asset in vessels.yaml.
# Vessel actions will be checked against capabilities/actions for validation.

# The code that calculates the values for these capabilities is action.getMetrics(). 
# Changes here won't be reflected in Irma unless the action.getMetrics() code is also updated.

# >>> Units to be converted to standard values, with optional converter script
# for allowing conventional unit inputs. <<<
