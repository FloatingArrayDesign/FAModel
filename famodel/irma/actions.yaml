# actions.yaml
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines standardized marine operations actions.
# Each entry needs numeric values per specific asset in vessels.yaml.
# Action requirements will be checked against vessel capabilities for evaluation and assignment.
#
#  Old format: roles, which lists asset roles, each with associated required capabilities
#  New format: list of requirements

# The code that models and checks these actions is action.calcDurationAndCost(). Structural changes here will not be reflected in the code unless changes are made there as well
